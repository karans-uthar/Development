# Introduction to CSS

### CSS Definition

**`CSS`** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a webpage.

### Why CSS is Important

1. **Separation of Content and Presentation**: CSS separates the content of a webpage (HTML) from its design (styles). This separation makes it easier to maintain and update both the content and the design independently.

2. **Consistency Across Pages**: By using an external CSS file, you can ensure that all pages on a website share the same design. This creates a consistent look and feel across the entire site.

3. **Efficiency and Maintainability**: With CSS, you can apply styles to multiple elements at once. This makes it easy to update the design by changing just a few lines of CSS, rather than updating the style of each HTML element individually.

4. **Enhanced User Experience**: CSS allows for responsive design, which means you can create web pages that look good on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones. This improves the user experience and accessibility.

5. **Performance**: CSS can be optimized to reduce the size of the stylesheets, leading to faster load times and better performance of web pages.

### How CSS is Different from HTML

**`Purpose:`**

  - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Used to structure content on the web. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other types of content.
  - **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Used to style and layout the content defined by HTML. It controls visual aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

**`Function:`**

  - **HTML**: Uses tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<img>`) to organize and display content on a webpage.
  - **CSS**: Uses selectors and style rules to apply styles to HTML elements. For example, `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, and `padding` are some of the properties you can set with CSS.

**`Syntax:`**

  - **HTML**:
    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Webpage</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```
  - **CSS**:
    ```css
    h1 {
      color: blue;
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    
    p {
      color: gray;
      font-size: 14px;
    }
    ```

**`Roles in Web Development`**:

  - **HTML**: Focuses on the content and structure of the webpage.
  - **CSS**: Focuses on the design and layout of the webpage.

**`Boilerplate:`**

Certainly! Below is a simple boilerplate for an HTML document with a linked CSS file. This template includes basic meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, as well as a basic CSS setup.

- **HTML Boilerplate**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="A brief description of the webpage for SEO purposes">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
            <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
            <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <main>
        <section id="section1">
            <h2>Section 1</h2>
            <p>This is the first section.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="section2">
            <h2>Section 2</h2>
            <p>This is the second section.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="section3">
            <h2>Section 3</h2>
            <p>This is the third section.</p>
        </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 Your Name. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

- **CSS Boilerplate**

Create a file named `styles.css` and include the following content:

```css
/* CSS Reset */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Basic styles */
body {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
}

/* Header styles */
header {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Navigation styles */
nav {
    margin: 20px 0;
}

nav ul {
    list-style: none;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
}

nav ul li {
    margin: 0 10px;
}

nav ul li a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #333;
}

/* Main content styles */
main {
    margin: 20px 0;
}

section {
    margin: 20px 0;
}

/* Footer styles */
footer {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
}
```

This boilerplate provides a basic structure for an HTML document and some default styling to get you started. You can expand and customize it according to your project's needs.

### Example of HTML and CSS Working Together

- **HTML**:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my webpage.</p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

- **CSS (styles.css)**:
  ```css
  body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  }

  h1 {
    color: blue;
    text-align: center;
  }

  p {
    color: gray;
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    margin: 20px;
  }
  ```

In summary, HTML provides the structure of the webpage, while CSS handles the styling. Both are essential for web development, but they serve distinct roles that complement each other to create functional and visually appealing websites.
